A rather late announcement on this site: this months meetup will be on Thursday 2012-05-24 19:00 at JayWay in Malmö, very close to the Centralstation.


## Talks

* "From Flash to Canvas - a penchant for black holes" by [Patric Jonsson](http://flashpatric.com)
* "Getting started with RequireJS" by [Morgan Roderick](http://roderick.dk)

We could still use a speaker or two, so if you have something to share, a cool project to show off, do drop us a note at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk> and tell us about your topic, and we will try to fit you in.
