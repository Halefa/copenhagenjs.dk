## Agenda

* Morgan Roderick: Closures, this, call and apply â€” an attempt at an explanation

We could still use a couple of speakers, so if you have something to share, a cool project to show off, do drop us a note at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk> and tell us about your topic, and we will try to fit you in.

## RSVP

To get an indication of how many are attending, please visit the [lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2011/cphjs-september/) and let us know if you're attending. Nothing is binding, we just need to know roughly how many drinks to prepare.
