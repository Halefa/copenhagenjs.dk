## Welcome to the August 2015 Barbeque meetup

We are trying to shake things up a little bit, and together with our friends
from Billy.dk, are we arranging a cozy barbeque meetup, where we will sit in
the afternoon sun and enjoy a great evening and maybe drink a chill beer.

There will be a panel discussion about "heavy frameworks", where the audience
will provide their quetions to the experts. It will be primarly about Ember.js
Angular.js, Meteor and Aurelia.

Because there is a limited amount of space, we need you to sign up for a ticket
which you can do very easily in the box underneath.

We are looking forward to see you!
