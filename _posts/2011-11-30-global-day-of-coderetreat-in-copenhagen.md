On the Global Day of Coderetreat, there will also be a code retreat in Copenhagen. [Having been to the code retreat in Berlin in July](http://roderick.dk/blog/2011/07/10/code-retreat-berlin/), I can only recommend participation in a code retreat. Great opportunities for picking up new skills, improving existing skills and meeting new people.

From the [coderetreat entry](http://coderetreat.ning.com/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-in-copenhagen):

>> Global Day of Coderetreat is about appreciating and improving the software craft.
>> The Copenhagen edition will be held at the AppHarbor office in Founders House. AppHarbor will sponsor lunch for the attendees.

>> Please join us at a quest for challenging our assumptions about the way we write code.
>> Go to the [Coderetreat website](http://coderetreat.ning.com/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-in-copenhagen) to learn more about the format - or just show up with your laptop this Saturday.
>> If people prefer, we can grab a beer afterwards to sum up the day and socialize with fellow craftsmen.

The event takes place at Founders House from 10am to 6pm on Saturday, 2011-12-03.

The organiser of the code retreat in Copenhagen has also [posted details in the CopenhagenJS Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/copenhagenjs/browse_thread/thread/7d96f525b5d07837)

I hope to see you there!
