At our very first meetup we promised video recordings of each speaker session.

It has taken some time, and now we managed to get a [new funky video site](http://copenhagenjs.23video.com/) up and running, which is kindly sponsored by danish rockstar [23Video](http://23video.com/).

The videoes from our August meetup is now online, where you can enjoy the wonderfull sessions by [Simon HÃ¸jberg](http://twitter.com/#!/shojberg), [Mads Hartmann Jensen](http://www.sidewayscoding.com), and [Daniel Pouzemski](http://twitter.com/#!/fredsmoo).
