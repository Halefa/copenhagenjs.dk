Sadly, we did not get nearly enough interest for the September 2011 meeting, so it is hereby canceled.

It was a bit of a long shot, since we were very late with the announcement for the meeting.

We will try to reschedule Jacob Hartmann SÃ¸rensen from IT- og Telestyrelsen to come an give his talk at the October meetup instead.

Morgan has promised to give his talk on "Closures, this, call and apply" for one of the upcoming meetings.
