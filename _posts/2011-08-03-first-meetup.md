We are pleased to announce the first CopenhagenJS meetup, which is going to take place **August 24th 2011 at 19.00** - roughly three weeks from now.

## Where?

The first meetup will take place at **Podio's Copenhagen office**, which is located in hip Vesterbro, just at Vesterbros torv, 5mins from the main train station. (Vesterbrogade 32, 1620 København V)

## Agenda

* Simon Højberg, Swipely: Building Single Page Applications with YUI
* Mads Hartmann Jensen: Purely Functional Data Structures for JavaScript
* Daniel Pouzemski: Backbone.js

We could still do with a few more talks, **lightning talks also welcome**.

## Call for speakers

If you have something you would like to share with the JavaScript community, why not give a talk at a meetup? You don't have to be Brendan Eich or Douglas Crockford to speak, all speakers are welcome.

Drop us a note at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk> and tell us about your topic, and we will try to fit you in.

We will try to coordinate and group related speakers together in the same meetup, to make it easier for the community members to decide if they want to attend a specific meetup.
