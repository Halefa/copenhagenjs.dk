We are pleased to announce the April CopenhagenJS meetup. The meetup takes place at **Thursday 2012-04-19 at 19.00.**, and is hosted by [RainMaking](http://rainmaking.co.uk/) in the very center of Copenhagen.

## Talks

* [Martin Jespersen](http://stackoverflow.com/users/572680/martin-jespersen): Pageload performance, profiling & optimization

We could still use a speaker or two, so if you have something to share, a cool project to show off, do drop us a note at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk> and tell us about your topic, and we will try to fit you in.

## Where?

Address: [Kristen Bernikows Gade 6, 1105](http://maps.google.dk/maps?q=Kristen+Bernikows+Gade+6,+1105&hl=en&ie=UTF8&t=h&hnear=Kristen+Bernikows+Gade+6,+1105+K%C3%B8benhavn,+Indre+By&z=16).

## RSVP

To get an indication of how many are attending, please visit the [Copenhagen JS April Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2012/copenhagenjs-april/) and let us know if you're attending. Nothing is binding, we just need to know roughly how many that will attend.
