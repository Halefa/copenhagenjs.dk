## Welcome to the November 2015 Meetup

This meetup will be a nice Wednesday instead of the normal Thursday because [Startup Safari Copenhagen](http://copenhagen.startupsafary.com/) is taking place that day.

We are looking for place to host the event, so if you have a place we can use be sure to reach us [twitter](https://twitter.com/copenhagenjs) or send us an email on [hello@copenhagenjs.dk](mailto:hello@copenhagenjs.dk)

There will be drinks and some snacks at the meetup, so you have to eat before.

So join us for a nice evening in the company of other JavaScript enthusiasts.
