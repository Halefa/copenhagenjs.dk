#HTML5 conference 

Together with our friends at [Lat55](http://www.lat55.se/), CopenhagenJS organises the HTML5 conference "Create The Web" in Copenhagen.

With HTML5 and CSS3, there's lots of new possibilities, but also a great need for new development tools. Adobe is very engaged in the open source tools that exist now and are coming.
