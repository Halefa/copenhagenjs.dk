# Blogging Challenge

Write a blogpost about _How did you find and start programming?_

You decide how you want to write it, if it should be long or short.

You can write it on your own blog and if you don't have one already then use
either medium.com or wordpress.com which are both really good places to get
started.

When you are done, submit your blogpost to this form:

All the participates will get a reward and we will highlight all the blogposts
at the next meetup.

Happy writing and looking forward to reading your posts!
