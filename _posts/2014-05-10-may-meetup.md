<h2>Welcome to our May meetup</h2>

The May CopenhagenJS meetup is hosted by [TBA](http://foo).

<h3>Help us find speakers</h3>

Do you know of some web technology topic that might be interesting to you? Maybe even to others?

Do you maybe even know of someone who might give a talk about that subject? Is that someone maybe you?

Why not give us a hand and [give us some speaker suggestions](http://copenhagenjs.dk/upcoming/). It will make the organization of CopenhagenJS easier and will keep the content interesting and diverse. This is a way that you can contribute to making our community great. 

We appreciate it!
