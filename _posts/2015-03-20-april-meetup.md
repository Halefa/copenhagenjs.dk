<h2>Back Again</h2>

The March meetup gave us some good feedback that people would actually like us to be back at our previous monthly schedule. So let's do it!

We'll try to be a bit quicker about updating the web page, setting up the Lanyrd event, finding speakers and promoting the event.

If you have a topic you'd like to talk about or hear about, please poke us on twitter: [@copenhagenjs](https://twitter.com/copenhagenjs)


<h2>Venue Missing</h2>

Would you like to host this CopenhagenJS meetup? [It's not that hard](/about/).

Please get a hold of us if you'd like to be the next host. We like to visit new places and let people show off their offices and culture. Serving food is a bonus, not a requirement.
